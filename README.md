# dt-geo-converter

The **dt-geo-converter** CLI tool converts CSV files exported from spreadsheets into CWL workflows and relationship data.

## Installation

2. **Prepare Your Data Source:**  
   You can use the tool with either:
   - Local CSV files: Create a directory containing the CSV files exported from your spreadsheets
   - Remote data: Import data directly from the Google Drive spreadsheets

## Data Sources

The tool supports two primary data sources:

1. **Local CSV Files:**  
   You can use CSV files exported from spreadsheets. The directory should either contain the CSV files directly (e.g., wf.csv, wf_wf.csv, etc.) or have subdirectories where each contains the expected CSV files. See the [example](./data) in the repository for guidance.

2. **Google Drive Integration:**  
   The tool can directly access and download spreadsheet data from the DT-GEO Google Drive, eliminating the need for manual exports. You can update the online spreadsheets and re-initialize the local database of the tool to fetch your changes.

## Output

The tool generates various outputs including:

- CWL workflow descriptions
- Workflow graphs
- Conversion log files
- ROâ€‘Crate metadata packages (Work In Progress)
